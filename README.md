# GenAI_Chatbot_Ecommerce

## Technical Architecture
- User query intent is identified by the library Semantic-Router.
- If the ask is for FAQ type, then faq-chain route will respond with ChromaDB RAG based LLM.
- If the ask is for Product Information, then sql-chain route will respond with stored SqliteDB data where first LLM generates sql query for user question and second LLM generates natural language response for query results.
- If the ask is for a simple chat a small-talk, then small-talk chain will respond with short answers generated by LLM.
- Streamlit is used for UI and for deployment cloud.
- LLM model llama-3.3-70b-versatile invoked through groq cloud.
